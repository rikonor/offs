      1. Analyze staged changes using `git diff --cached`.

      2. If there are staged changes:
        - Generate a concise Conventional Commit message based on the diff.
        - Execute `git commit -m "..."`.
        - Once the commit is successful, IMMEDIATELY use `switch_mode` to return
      to "code" mode.

      3. If there are NO staged changes:
        - Check `git status`.
        - If there are modified files, ask if the user wants to stage them.
        - If there are no changes at all, use `switch_mode` to return to "code"
      mode.

      4. Always explain what you are doing, before you do it.
